## Purpose
This is a for-fun project to build a POC/MVP for a deckbuilder game in [Unity-2d](https://unity.com/solutions/2d) game engine. [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) was taken as starting inspiration. The end goal is to get a playable demo up that doesnt look like it was made by someone brand new to game development.

Current build is hosted on AWS [here](http://deck-builder-demo-nckackerman.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

## Can I use this code?

## Updates

### 1/11/2021 

The very basic gameloop is working. Funtionality includes:
- Deck of cards that can be played.
- Cards for Attacking/Defending/Drawing
- Enemies that will attack/defend each turn
- Fight rewards where players can add cards to their deck

Whats next?
- Look into incorporating assets into the game
- Continue defining what the game should be. Need more of a design than "POC/MVP" deck builder
